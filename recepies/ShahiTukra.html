        <h2>Description Heading</h2>
    <p>This is a very famous Hyderabadi dish and is a very simple, but rich dessert. It is great for a large dinner
        party as the recipe can be easily multiplied to make more. It is best eaten chilled. If available, you can add a
        few drops of Kewra essence to the milk mixture once it has cooled.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart oil for deep frying </li>
            <li>8 slices white bread, crusts removed and cut into 4 squares</li>
            <li>¼ cup cashews</li>
            <li>¼ cup sliced almonds</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pistachio nuts</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons evaporated milk</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong> Step 1 </strong></dt>
            <dd>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the bread slices in the hot oil until deep, golden brown; drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Fry the cashews, almonds, and pistachio nuts in the hot oil until golden brown; remove from oil and set aside to cool. Chop roughly.</dd>
        
            <dt><strong> Step 2 </strong></dt>
            <dd>Bring the milk to a gentle boil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low heat; continue boiling until the volume of milk reduces by about half. Pour the evaporated milk into the pan and add the sugar, cardamom, and saffron; simmer together 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.</dd>
        
            <dt><strong> Step 3 </strong></dt>
            <dd>Arrange the fried bread pieces in a shallow dish large enough to allow them to be laid in a single layer. Evenly pour the milk mixture over the bread. Scatter the chopped nuts over the bread. Chill in refrigerator until completely cold, 1 to 2 hours.</dd>
